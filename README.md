        <p>bor my final project I would like to try and convert all the rules found in “The Elements of Style” into code and form an engine where text can be inputted. The engine will then produce the corrected text (with possible variations depending on the rule) and a report. The report would highlight the changes made to the sentence and explain why the change was made. It might even point to the more detailed text in “The Elements of Style” so that the user can have a more in-depth understanding. I will try to incorporate secondary sources in the form of information from other style books that might  disagree with “The Elements of Style” so that the user can see that they might not necessarily be “wrong”. I felt that the biggest issue and also a valuable skill in most professions is writing ability. Writing business emails,cover letters, and essays, there are a lot of information in the word that needs to be written down. I actually struggle with changing my style to match the circumstances so this project would help me practice and learn in a few areas of writing and programming and also be helpful to other students. I felt it was more a more practical project.</p>

<h1 id="header-1">Sources 1-10</h1>

<p><strong>Source Summary:</strong> E.B White’s former professor composed this mini-guide to editing content and the “style” of minimalism in writing, which he in turn published on a larger scale and added some of his own wisdom to. Initially starting as a “beware of these” grammar rule set, the book moves into a more philosophical look at the composition of words and how elusive true writing style can be, and how to build your own style following some key, structural rules.

<h3 id="and-an-ordered-list">Outline of Rules 1-44 </h3>

<ol>
  <li>Elementary Rules of Usage</li>
  <ul>
  <li>Form the possessive singular of nouns by adding ‘s
    <ul>
      <li>Exceptions: possessives of ancient proper names endings with –es and – is. </li>
      <li>Pronominal possessives hers, its, theirs, yours and ours have no apostrophes. Indefinite pronouns use apostrophe’s to show possession</li>
      <li> It’s means “it is”, not to confuse it with possession.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>In a series of three or more terms with a single conjunction, use a comma after each term except the last
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Enclose parenthetic expressions between commas
    <ul>
      <li>Never omit one comma and leave the other</li>
      <li>Dates usually contain parenthetic words or figures</li>
      <li>The abbreviations etc., i.e., and e.g. , the abbreviations for academic degrees, and titled that follow a name are parenthetic</li>
      <li>No comma should separate a noun from a restrictive term of identification</li>
      <li>Junior (abbreviated Jr.) does not need a comma </li>
      <li>Nonrestrictive relative clauses are parenthetic and is one that does not serve to identify or define the antecedent noun</li>
      <li> Restrictive clauses are not parenthetic and are not set off by commas.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Place a comma before a conjunction introducing an independent clause. 
    <ul>
      <li>Two-part sentences of which the second member is introduced by as, for, or, nor, or while require a comma before a conjunction </li>
      <li>Omit the connection and when the relation of the two statements is similar</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Do not join independent clauses with a comma
    <ul>
      <li>Instead, use a semicolon</li>
      <li>If a conjunction is inserted, use a comma</li>
      <li> If the second clause is preceded by an adverb ( such as accordingly, besides, then, therefore…) the semicolon is required</li>
      <li>Exception to semicolon rule: If the clauses are very short, use a comma</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Do not break sentences in two
    <ul>
      <li>You can change the period into a comma and make the following letter lowercase </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Use a colon after an independent clause to introduce a list of particulars, an appositive, amplification, or an illustrative quotation
    <ul>
      <li>Join two independent clauses with a colon if the second interprets the first</li>
      <li>A colon can introduce a quotation</li>
      <li>A colon follows a salutation of a formal letter, separated hour from minute, and separates the title of work from its subtitle or a Bible chapter from a verse </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Use a dash to set off an abrupt break or interruption and to announce a long appositive or summary
    <ul>
      <li> A dash is a stronger mark of separation than a comma, but less formal than a colon and more relaxed than a parenthesis</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>The number of the subject determines the number of the verb
    <ul>
      <li>Words that intervene b/w the subject and verb do not affect the number of the verb</li>
      <li> Use a singular verb form after each  either, everyone, everybody, neither, nobody, someone </li>
      <li> Use singular verb when ‘none’ means “no one” or “not one”</li>
      <li> Compound subject=plural verb </li>
      <li>Clichés take a singular verb</li>
      <li> Singular subject remains singular even if other nouns are connected by with, as well as, in addition to, except, together with, no less than </li>
      <li>Nouns that may appear to be plural are usually singular</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Use the proper case of pronoun
    <ul>
      <li>Personal pronouns change form as they function as subject or object</li>
      <li> A pronoun in a comparison is nominative</li>
      <li>Avoid “understood” verbs by supplying them</li>
      <li>Use the simple personal pronoun as the subject </li>
      <li>The possessive case- adjectival: your hat; noun form: a hat of yours.</li>
      <li>Gerunds require the possessive case</li>
      <li>Present participle as a verbal takes the objective case </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>A participle phrase at the beginning of a sentence must refer to the grammatical subject
  </li>
</ul>
  <li>Elementary Principles of Comparison</li>
<ul>
  <li>Choose a suitable design and hold to it
    <ul>
      <li> In some cases, the best design is no design </li>
      <li>1st principle of composition: to determine the shape of what is to come and pursue the shape </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Make the paragraph the unit of composition 
    <ul>
      <li>Paragraph serves all forms of literary works. </li>
      <li>Can be of any length- from a sentence to a long passage </li>
      <li>Division of paragraphs isn’t always necessary, especially if your topic is brief </li>
      <li>Single sentences should not be written or printed as paragraphs- except sentences of transitions </li>
      <li>Each speech in dialogue is a paragraph with the change of the speaker</li>
      <li>Use topic sentences to introduce your topic; animated narrative sometimes has not topic sentence</li>
      <li> Try to cut really long paragraphs shorter, but don’t have too many short paragraphs </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Use the active voice
    <ul>
      <li>Active voice is more direct than passive </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Put statements in positive forms
    <ul>
      <li>Make definite assertions; avoid colorless, noncommittal language; use ‘not’ only as a means of denial</li>
      <li>It is better to express a negative in positive form</li>
      <li>If a sentence admits a doubt, it lacks authority—avoid this </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Use definite, specific, concrete, language.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Omit needless words
    <ul>
      <li>A sentence should not contain unnecessary words </li>
      <li>The fact that is debilitating expression and should always be revised</li>
      <li>The words who is, which was, and the like are often superfluous</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Avoid a succession of loose sentences.
    <ul>
      <li>Rule refers to sentences of a particular type: those consisting of two clauses, the second introduced by a conjunction or a relative</li>
      <li>Use which, who, when, where, while instead of so much and, but</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Express coordinate ideas in similar form</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Keep related words together
    <ul>
      <li>The subject of a sentence and the principal verb should not be separated </li>
      <li>Interposing a phrase or a clause interrupts the flow of the main clause. The relative pronoun should come immediately after its antecedent</li>
      <li>If the antecedent consists of a group of words, the relative comes at the end of the group </li>
      <li>A noun in apposition may come between the antecedent and relative </li>
      <li>Modifiers should come, if possible, next to the word they modify </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>In summaries, keep to one tense
    <ul>
      <li> Summarizing the action of drama (present tense)</li>
      <li>Poems, stories, or novel (present tense, you may use past tense if it seems more natural)</li>
      <li>Keep same tense throughout your writing</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Place the emphatic words of a sentence at the end 
    <ul>
      <li>The proper place in the sentence for the word or group of words that the writer desired to make most prominent is usually the end</li>
      <li> A subject coming first in its sentence may be emphatic, but hardly by its position alone. </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
  <li>A Few Matters of Form</li>
<ul>
  <li>Colloquialisms: if a colloquialism, slang word, or phrase is used, do not draw attention to it by enclosing it in quotation marks </li>
  <li> Exclamations:  do not attempt to emphasize simple statements by using exclamation points </li>
  <li>Headings: If a manuscripts is to be submitted for publication, leave plenty of space at the top of the page 1. The editor will use the space to write directions to the compositor. Place the heading at least a fourth way down the page. Leave a blank line after the heading. Omit the period of the headline, but use a question mark or exclamation point it necessary </li>
  <li>Hyphen:  when two or more words are combined to form a compound adjective, a hyphen is required </li>
  <ul>
      <li>Do not use a hyphen on words that are better combined as one</li>
    </ul>
  <li>Margins: keep right-hand and left-hand margins roughly the same width </li>
  <li>Numerals: do not spell out dated or other serial numbers. Write them in figures or in Roman notation. The only exception is if you write it out in dialogue</li>
  <li>Parentheses: A sentence containing an expression in parenthesis is punctuated outside the last mark of parenthesis exactly as if the parenthetical expression were absent </li>
  <li>Quotations: Formal quotations cited as documentary evidence are introduced by a colon and enclosed in quotation marks. </li>
<ul>
      <li>A quotation grammatically in apposition or the direct object of a verb is proceeded by a comma and enclosed in quotation marks</li>
    <li>When a quotation is followed by an attributive phrase, the comma is enclosed within the quotation marks</li>
    <li>Proverbial expressions and familiar phrases of literary origin require no quotations </li>
    </ul>
  <li>References</li>
  <ul>
      <li>In scholarly work requiring exact reference, abbreviate titles that appear frequently </li>
    <li>Give the full forms in an alphabetical list at the end</li>
    <li>Give reference in parenthesis and footnotes </li>
    <li>Omit the words: act, scene, line, book, volume, page </li>
    </ul>
  <li>Syllabication</li>
  <ul>
      <li>When a word must be divided at the end of a line, consult a dictionary to learn the syllables</li>
    </ul>
  <li>Titles</li>
  <ul>
      <li>Use italics for titles with capitalized initials</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<li>Approach to Style</li>
<ul>
  <li>Place yourself in the background
  <ul>
      <li>Use italics for titles with capitalized initials</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
