        <p>For my final project I would like to try and convert all the rules found in “The Elements of Style” into code and form an engine where text can be inputted. The engine will then produce the corrected text (with possible variations depending on the rule) and a report. The report would highlight the changes made to the sentence and explain why the change was made. It might even point to the more detailed text in “The Elements of Style” so that the user can have a more in-depth understanding. I will try to incorporate secondary sources in the form of information from other style books that might  disagree with “The Elements of Style” so that the user can see that they might not necessarily be “wrong”. I felt that the biggest issue and also a valuable skill in most professions is writing ability. Writing business emails,cover letters, and essays, there are a lot of information in the word that needs to be written down. I actually struggle with changing my style to match the circumstances so this project would help me practice and learn in a few areas of writing and programming and also be helpful to other students. I felt it was more a more practical project.</p>

<h1 id="header-1">Primary Sources of Coding Rules</h1>

<p><strong>Source Summary:</strong> E.B White’s former professor composed this mini-guide to editing content and the “style” of minimalism in writing, which he in turn published on a larger scale and added some of his own wisdom to. Initially starting as a “beware of these” grammar rule set, the book moves into a more philosophical look at the composition of words and how elusive true writing style can be, and how to build your own style following some key, structural rules.

<h3 id="and-an-ordered-list">Outline of Rules 1-44 </h3>

<ol>
  <li>Elementary Rules of Usage</li>
  <ul>
  <li>Form the possessive singular of nouns by adding ‘s
    <ul>
      <li>Exceptions: possessives of ancient proper names endings with –es and – is. </li>
      <li>Pronominal possessives hers, its, theirs, yours and ours have no apostrophes. Indefinite pronouns use apostrophe’s to show possession</li>
      <li> It’s means “it is”, not to confuse it with possession.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>In a series of three or more terms with a single conjunction, use a comma after each term except the last
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Enclose parenthetic expressions between commas
    <ul>
      <li>Never omit one comma and leave the other</li>
      <li>Dates usually contain parenthetic words or figures</li>
      <li>The abbreviations etc., i.e., and e.g. , the abbreviations for academic degrees, and titled that follow a name are parenthetic</li>
      <li>No comma should separate a noun from a restrictive term of identification</li>
      <li>Junior (abbreviated Jr.) does not need a comma </li>
      <li>Nonrestrictive relative clauses are parenthetic and is one that does not serve to identify or define the antecedent noun</li>
      <li> Restrictive clauses are not parenthetic and are not set off by commas.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Place a comma before a conjunction introducing an independent clause. 
    <ul>
      <li>Two-part sentences of which the second member is introduced by as, for, or, nor, or while require a comma before a conjunction </li>
      <li>Omit the connection and when the relation of the two statements is similar</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Do not join independent clauses with a comma
    <ul>
      <li>Instead, use a semicolon</li>
      <li>If a conjunction is inserted, use a comma</li>
      <li> If the second clause is preceded by an adverb ( such as accordingly, besides, then, therefore…) the semicolon is required</li>
      <li>Exception to semicolon rule: If the clauses are very short, use a comma</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Do not break sentences in two
    <ul>
      <li>You can change the period into a comma and make the following letter lowercase </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Use a colon after an independent clause to introduce a list of particulars, an appositive, amplification, or an illustrative quotation
    <ul>
      <li>Join two independent clauses with a colon if the second interprets the first</li>
      <li>A colon can introduce a quotation</li>
      <li>A colon follows a salutation of a formal letter, separated hour from minute, and separates the title of work from its subtitle or a Bible chapter from a verse </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Use a dash to set off an abrupt break or interruption and to announce a long appositive or summary
    <ul>
      <li> A dash is a stronger mark of separation than a comma, but less formal than a colon and more relaxed than a parenthesis</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>The number of the subject determines the number of the verb
    <ul>
      <li>Words that intervene b/w the subject and verb do not affect the number of the verb</li>
      <li> Use a singular verb form after each  either, everyone, everybody, neither, nobody, someone </li>
      <li> Use singular verb when ‘none’ means “no one” or “not one”</li>
      <li> Compound subject=plural verb </li>
      <li>Clichés take a singular verb</li>
      <li> Singular subject remains singular even if other nouns are connected by with, as well as, in addition to, except, together with, no less than </li>
      <li>Nouns that may appear to be plural are usually singular</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Use the proper case of pronoun
    <ul>
      <li>Personal pronouns change form as they function as subject or object</li>
      <li> A pronoun in a comparison is nominative</li>
      <li>Avoid “understood” verbs by supplying them</li>
      <li>Use the simple personal pronoun as the subject </li>
      <li>The possessive case- adjectival: your hat; noun form: a hat of yours.</li>
      <li>Gerunds require the possessive case</li>
      <li>Present participle as a verbal takes the objective case </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>A participle phrase at the beginning of a sentence must refer to the grammatical subject
  </li>
</ul>
  <li>Elementary Principles of Comparison</li>
<ul>
  <li>Choose a suitable design and hold to it
    <ul>
      <li> In some cases, the best design is no design </li>
      <li>1st principle of composition: to determine the shape of what is to come and pursue the shape </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Make the paragraph the unit of composition 
    <ul>
      <li>Paragraph serves all forms of literary works. </li>
      <li>Can be of any length- from a sentence to a long passage </li>
      <li>Division of paragraphs isn’t always necessary, especially if your topic is brief </li>
      <li>Single sentences should not be written or printed as paragraphs- except sentences of transitions </li>
      <li>Each speech in dialogue is a paragraph with the change of the speaker</li>
      <li>Use topic sentences to introduce your topic; animated narrative sometimes has not topic sentence</li>
      <li> Try to cut really long paragraphs shorter, but don’t have too many short paragraphs </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Use the active voice
    <ul>
      <li>Active voice is more direct than passive </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Put statements in positive forms
    <ul>
      <li>Make definite assertions; avoid colorless, noncommittal language; use ‘not’ only as a means of denial</li>
      <li>It is better to express a negative in positive form</li>
      <li>If a sentence admits a doubt, it lacks authority—avoid this </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Use definite, specific, concrete, language.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Omit needless words
    <ul>
      <li>A sentence should not contain unnecessary words </li>
      <li>The fact that is debilitating expression and should always be revised</li>
      <li>The words who is, which was, and the like are often superfluous</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Avoid a succession of loose sentences.
    <ul>
      <li>Rule refers to sentences of a particular type: those consisting of two clauses, the second introduced by a conjunction or a relative</li>
      <li>Use which, who, when, where, while instead of so much and, but</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Express coordinate ideas in similar form</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Keep related words together
    <ul>
      <li>The subject of a sentence and the principal verb should not be separated </li>
      <li>Interposing a phrase or a clause interrupts the flow of the main clause. The relative pronoun should come immediately after its antecedent</li>
      <li>If the antecedent consists of a group of words, the relative comes at the end of the group </li>
      <li>A noun in apposition may come between the antecedent and relative </li>
      <li>Modifiers should come, if possible, next to the word they modify </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>In summaries, keep to one tense
    <ul>
      <li> Summarizing the action of drama (present tense)</li>
      <li>Poems, stories, or novel (present tense, you may use past tense if it seems more natural)</li>
      <li>Keep same tense throughout your writing</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Place the emphatic words of a sentence at the end 
    <ul>
      <li>The proper place in the sentence for the word or group of words that the writer desired to make most prominent is usually the end</li>
      <li> A subject coming first in its sentence may be emphatic, but hardly by its position alone. </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
  <li>A Few Matters of Form</li>
<ul>
  <li>Colloquialisms: if a colloquialism, slang word, or phrase is used, do not draw attention to it by enclosing it in quotation marks </li>
  <li> Exclamations:  do not attempt to emphasize simple statements by using exclamation points </li>
  <li>Headings: If a manuscripts is to be submitted for publication, leave plenty of space at the top of the page 1. The editor will use the space to write directions to the compositor. Place the heading at least a fourth way down the page. Leave a blank line after the heading. Omit the period of the headline, but use a question mark or exclamation point it necessary </li>
  <li>Hyphen:  when two or more words are combined to form a compound adjective, a hyphen is required </li>
  <ul>
      <li>Do not use a hyphen on words that are better combined as one</li>
    </ul>
  <li>Margins: keep right-hand and left-hand margins roughly the same width </li>
  <li>Numerals: do not spell out dated or other serial numbers. Write them in figures or in Roman notation. The only exception is if you write it out in dialogue</li>
  <li>Parentheses: A sentence containing an expression in parenthesis is punctuated outside the last mark of parenthesis exactly as if the parenthetical expression were absent </li>
  <li>Quotations: Formal quotations cited as documentary evidence are introduced by a colon and enclosed in quotation marks. </li>
<ul>
      <li>A quotation grammatically in apposition or the direct object of a verb is proceeded by a comma and enclosed in quotation marks</li>
    <li>When a quotation is followed by an attributive phrase, the comma is enclosed within the quotation marks</li>
    <li>Proverbial expressions and familiar phrases of literary origin require no quotations </li>
    </ul>
  <li>References</li>
  <ul>
      <li>In scholarly work requiring exact reference, abbreviate titles that appear frequently </li>
    <li>Give the full forms in an alphabetical list at the end</li>
    <li>Give reference in parenthesis and footnotes </li>
    <li>Omit the words: act, scene, line, book, volume, page </li>
    </ul>
  <li>Syllabication</li>
  <ul>
      <li>When a word must be divided at the end of a line, consult a dictionary to learn the syllables</li>
    </ul>
  <li>Titles</li>
  <ul>
      <li>Use italics for titles with capitalized initials</li>

<h3 id="and-an-ordered-list">On Writing Well Points </h3>
<h4><b>GOOD WRITING IS CLEAR, SIMPLE, CONCISE, AND HUMAN.</b></h4>
<p><b>Be Clear.</b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><i>“Give the reader a narrative flow he can follow with no trouble from beginning to end.”</i></p>
</blockquote>
<ul><li>The reader should find it easy to follow.</li><li>The writing should be structured, linear, flowing, emphatic, and familiar.</li><li>The writer should set a single intention, research extensively, think clearly, structure carefully and use analogies.</li></ul>
<p><b>Be Simple.</b></p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>“A simple style is the result of hard work and hard thinking; a muddled style reflects a muddled thinker.”</i></p>
</blockquote>
<ul><li>The reader should find it easy to read.</li><li>The writing should contain short and simple paragraphs, sentences, and words.</li><li>The writer should test by reading aloud. Always remember the reader and shorten words where possible.</li></ul>
<p><b>Be Concise.</b></p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>“The secret of good writing is to strip every sentence to its cleanest components.”</i></p>
</blockquote>
<ul><li>The reader should find each point quick to understand.</li><li>The writing should use words that are surprising, strong, and precise in their meaning.</li><li>The writer should <a href="#clutter">eliminate clutter</a> (“Good writing is lean and emphatic.”), avoid cliché and jargon, and commit (“Don’t hedge with little timidities.”)</li></ul>
<p><b>Be Human.</b></p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>“Writing is an intimate transaction between two people… and it will go well to the extent that it retains its humanity.”</i></p>
</blockquote>
<ul><li>The reader should be able to relate to both content and author.</li><li>The writing should feel personal, energetic, specific, and concrete.</li><li>The writer should write like a person, tell a story, use quotes, use detail to illustrate the general, and have fun.</li></ul>
<h4><b>GOOD WRITING GROWS FROM GOOD PROCESS.</b></h4>
<p><b>Set intention.</b></p>
<ul><li>“Decide what single point you want to leave in the reader’s mind”.</li><li>Decide how you plan to put it there.</li></ul>
<p><b>Research.</b></p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>“Readers should always feel that you know more about a subject than you put in writing.”</i></p>
</blockquote>
<ul><li>Go after your research; if it interests you then “get on the plane”: travel to the next town, county, or county to find it.</li><li>“Always collect more material than you will use.”</li><li>“Look for your material everywhere”, not just in the obvious places.</li><li>And follow surprises. “Surprise is the most refreshing element in non-fiction writing. If something surprises you it will also surprise – and delight – the people you are writing for.”</li></ul>
<p><b>Think.</b></p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>“Clear thinking becomes clear writing; one can’t exist without the other.”</i></p>
</blockquote>
<ul><li>Select: Use less than you have.</li><li>Reduce: Explain big by thinking small. Tell a story.</li><li>Organise: Clear writing &lt;==&gt; Clear thinking.</li><li>“Your subconscious mind does more writing than you think” so, “never go to sleep without a request to [it].” — Thomas Edison</li></ul>
<p><b>Write.</b></p>
<ul><li>Go easy on yourself (“The first draft of anything is shit.” — Earnest Hemmingway)</li><li>Put yourself into the writing by always writing the first draft in the first person (then go back and remove the ‘I’s if you must).</li><li>Trust and adapt to your material: “Don’t become the prisoner of a preconceived plan”.</li><li>When you get stuck ask yourself “What is this piece <i>really</i> about?”</li></ul>
<p><b>Rewrite.</b></p>
<ul><li>Read aloud; remove anything you wouldn’t actually say.</li><li>Edit on paper; process the full composition with a pen, then apply edits.</li><li>Continuously strengthen, tighten and make the language more precise.</li><li>Repeat. Repeat. Repeat: “Rewriting is the essence of writing well; it’s where the game is won or lost.”</li></ul>
<p><b>Defend.</b></p>
<ul><li>A good editor brings an “objective eye” and “can’t be thanked fervently enough”.</li><li>But defend against direct edits to (a) style and (b) content: “If you allow your distinctiveness to be edited out, you will lose one of your major virtues.”</li></ul>
<h4><b>THE ANATOMY OF WRITING WELL.</b></h4>
<p><b>Words.</b></p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>“Writing that endures consists of words that are short and strong.”</i></p>
</blockquote>
<ul><li>Use short words over long words.</li><li>Use verbs over nouns.</li><li>Verbs: Use active verbs over passive verbs.<ul><li>“The ground <b>was covered</b> in leaves.” → “Leaves <b>covered</b> the ground”</li></ul></li><li>Nouns: Make people act, not concepts.<ul><li>“<b>The first reaction is</b> often laughter.” → “<b>People </b>often laugh.”</li></ul></li><li>Use adverbs only where they change meaning. (See <a href="#clutter">“How to: Cleanse Clutter”</a>)</li><li>Use adjectives only where they surprise or inform.&nbsp; (See <a href="#clutter">“How to: Cleanse Clutter”</a>)</li><li>Use neutral over sexist or gendered language. (See <a href="#sexism">“How to: Side-step Sexism”</a>)</li><li>“Get in the habit of using dictionaries” and a thesaurus*.</li></ul>
<p>* If you’re looking for an immediate next action: why not set up a good dictionary and thesaurus on your computer?</p>
<p><b>Sentences.</b></p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>“Readers read with their eyes. But in fact, they hear what they are reading far more than you realise.”</i></p>
</blockquote>
<ul><li>Make sentences short and rhythmic.<ul><li>Within: “Rhythm and alliteration are vital to every sentence.”</li><li>Between: “See if you can gain variety by reversing the order of a sentence or by substituting a word that has freshness or oddity or by altering the length of your sentences.”</li></ul></li><li>Make sentences flow.<ul><li>Remember where you left the reader in the last sentence.</li><li>Indicate mood changes (e.g., now, but, later) early in the current sentence.</li><li>Build suspense for the next sentence.</li></ul></li><li>Make sentences unique (advance, don’t restate).</li><li>Remember: “a difficult problem in a sentence can [often] be solved by simply getting rid of it.”</li></ul>
<p><b>Paragraphs.&nbsp;</b></p>
<blockquote>

<p><strong>Source Summary:</strong> As The Chicago Manual of Style is primarily intended as a style guide for published works rather than for class papers, where necessary, CMOS guidelines will be supplemented with information from the student reference, Kate L. Turabian’s Manual for Writers of Research Papers, Theses, and Dissertations (8th ed.), which is largely based on CMOS with some slight alterations and additions.

<li>Choose your thesis statement- Your outline must begin with your thesis statement. Everything in your outline should relate to this thesis statement. Your thesis statement should start with the Roman numeral “I” followed by a period.</li>
<li>Roman numerals are used for all of your major points. Each Roman numeral represents a paragraph.</li>
<li>The ideas that you have found to support your main points should all begin with capital letters. These ideas that begin with capital letters should be indented one space past the Roman numerals.</li>
<li>Depending on how many categories you need to support each of your ideas will depend on how you indicate them on your paper.</li>
</ol>
<p><em>This is an example of what the outline might look like:</em></p>

<p>Above is an example of what the outline may look like for a Chicago style research paper. There are many places on the internet that will show you additional examples such as (insert web site of your choice). If you follow these guidelines, you will successfully create your outline which in turn will be the foundation for a research paper.</p>
<p>You should have done all of your research at this time and organized all of your data so you can organize them to be input into your outline. Once you have completed your outline, you have done most of the hard work. All that is left is putting your main points into complete sentences. Follow your “map” and you will have no problem having a great flowing, concise, thorough research paper.</p>

<ul>
<li>Direct quotations</li>
<li>Paraphrases and summaries</li>
<li>Information and ideas that are not common knowledge, or are not available in a common reference work</li>
<li>Any information that you have borrowed, or anything that could be interpreted as your own if not cited</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="contributor-information-and-titles">Contributor Information and Titles</h2>
<p><strong>One author:</strong></p>
<p class="citation">Last, First M.</p>
<p class="citation"><strong>Two authors:</strong></p>
<p class="citation">Last, First M., and First M. Last.</p>
<p><strong>More than 10 authors:</strong></p>
<p class="citation">List the first seven authors, followed by <em>et al</em>.</p>
<h4 id="authors-who-use-initials-in-their-first-names-e-g-j-k-rowling-c-s-lewis-add-a-space-between-their-initials">Authors who use initials in their first names (e.g., J.K. Rowling, C.S. Lewis), add a space between their initials.</h4>
<p>For works with an editor/translator/compiler and no author, list the contributor’s name, followed by ed./eds., comp./comps. or trans. after the contributor(s) last name(s), preceded by a comma.</p>
<p><strong>One editor:</strong></p>
<p class="citation">Last, First M., ed.</p>
<p><strong>Two authors:</strong></p>
<p class="citation">Last, First M., and First M. Last, trans.</p>
<p>For works with authors and additional contributors – such as an article in an edited anthology – list the author’s name first. After the article title, list the additional contributor names, preceded by Edited by, Compiled by, Translated by or Ed., Comp., or Trans.</p>
<p>If a work has an editor and a translator, list them in the same order as they appear on the title page.</p>
<h4 id="anonymous-works">Anonymous Works</h4>
<p>If the author is unknown, begin the citation with the title.</p>
<h2 id="organizing-your-bibliography">Organizing Your Bibliography</h2>
<p>Arrange citations entries in a reference list alphabetically by the author’s last name.</p>
<h4 id="multiple-works-by-different-authors-with-the-same-last-name-should-be-alphabetized-by-the-authors-first-initials">Multiple works by different authors with the same last name should be alphabetized by the authors’ first initials.</h4>
<h4 id="if-a-work-is-authored-by-a-group-or-corporation-it-should-be-listed-as-an-author-and-alphabetized-by-the-first-word-in-the-groups-name">If a work is authored by a group or corporation, it should be listed as an author and alphabetized by the first word in the group’s name.</h4>
<h2 id="capitalization-rules">Capitalization Rules</h2>
<p>Capitalization in Chicago style follows standard “headline capitalization” rules.</p>
<p><strong>Capitalize:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The first and last word of article or publication titles</li>
<li>All major words, including:
<ul>
<li>Nouns</li>
<li>Pronouns</li>
<li>Adjectives</li>
<li>Verbs</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="some-notes-about-notes">Some Notes About Notes</h2>
<p>Here are some tips about the use of footnotes/endnotes in Chicago/Turabian:</p>
<ul>
<li>Footnotes come at the bottom of each page, separated from the text with a line. Some instructors prefer that you use endnotes, which are included on a separate page (titled “Notes”) at the end of your paper.</li>
<li>To acknowledge a source in your paper, place a superscript number (raised slightly and smaller font size) immediately after the end punctuation of a sentence containing a quotation or reference. Do not put any additional punctuation after the number.</li>
<li>In the footnote or endnote itself, use the same number as your in-text reference.</li>
<li>If a single paragraph of your paper contains multiple references to the same source, it is fine to create a single footnote/endnote entry.</li>
<li>Most word processing programs, such as Microsoft Word, offer options to automate creating footnotes/endnotes.</li>
<li>Check with your instructor before completing your paper to confirm which note style option they prefer you use.</li>
</ul>
